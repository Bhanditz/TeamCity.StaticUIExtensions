           js-file="[include js file from this folder]"
           css-files="[include css file from this folder]">
         
         <!-- this is the rule to make page place work only for URLs that starts with -->
         <url starts="overview.html" />

         <!-- use empty path to match all pages -->
         <url starts="" />

         <!-- this is the rule to only include content if URL is equal to  -->
         <url equals="viewType.html" />

        You can add as many rules / url constraints as you like.
     </rule>
```
